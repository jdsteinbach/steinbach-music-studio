I'm a published composer, accompanist and church pianist with twelve years of experience teaching violin, viola, cello and piano. I began taking violin lessons at age 3 and have loved music ever since! I have a Bachelor of Science in Music Education with a concentration in piano and a Master of Arts in Church Music with a concentration in composition.

I'm passionate about teaching others to express themselves through music and instilling a lifelong love for music in my students. My favorite things to teach are improvisation and composition. No matter what you want to play- classical or pop, lead sheets or sheet music- excellent musicianship starts with good technique and theory. My teaching style is very student oriented, and I love helping students have fun and really enjoy the process as they learn and grow musically.
